# C# exercise 2 - Flow control and string manipulation

This is the second C# exercise for the Full-stack system developer program from Lexicon.

## MenuFlow
The program implements a simple console-based menu system that allows users to select from various options. The menu is displayed in a loop until the user chooses to exit:
1) Youth or Pensioner
2) Repeat ten times
3) The third word

### Option 1: Youth or Pensioner
To demonstrate if statements, a fictional local movie theater offers discounted tickets for youth (under 20) and pensioners (64 and older). The user is prompted to enter their age, and the program determines if they are eligible for a discount, displaying the resulting price.

The program should also be able to calculate the price for a group of people. The user is prompted to enter the number of people in the group, and then the age of each person. The program calculates the total price for the group based on the individual prices and prints out a summary containing the number of people and the calculated total price.

### Option 2: Repeat ten times
TBD
### Option 3: The third word
TBD
